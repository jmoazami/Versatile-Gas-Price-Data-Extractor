# Versatile-Gas-Price-Data-Extractor
Solution to AlphaPoint Challenge. Given how exchanges working on the Ethereum blockchain must pay gas fees everytime a transaction is done on the blockchain, it is necessary to reduce the costs of these fees to efficently work on the blockchain and save company funds. To do so, I have  developed a server written in Python, server.py, that makes use of functions  written in data.py to ingest free gas price data provided by Etherscan in a mySQL  data table using my personal API key. I then present this data to the user in a meaningful  way by giving average gas price over an inputted period of time (with proper error handling) or providing the most recent gas price in my data.
